title: Set up Casdoor
---

## Installation

It is very simple to install Casdoor, you can use `go get`

```shell
go get github.com/casbin/casdoor
```

or use `git clone`

```shell
git clone https://github.com/casbin/casdoor
```

## Config

All configures are placed in `conf/`, including `app.conf` and `oss.conf`. The former stores application-related infomation, while the latter only stores OSS-related configuration. You can modify two files to set all configures.

But for the first time of use, you donâ€™t need to figure out everything, which will be introduced later. Now you just need a few simple configures to run casdoor on your personal computer.

Nevertheless, the database info should be configured first. Casdoor uses [XORM](https://xorm.io/) framework to connect to DB, so all DBs supported by XORM can also be used.

- Setup database (MySQL):

  Casdoor will store its users, nodes and topics informations in a MySQL database named: `casdoor`, will create it if not existed. The DB connection string can be specified at: https://github.com/casbin/casdoor/blob/master/conf/app.conf

  ```ini
  driverName = mysql
  dataSourceName = root:123@tcp(localhost:3306)/
  dbName = casdoor
  ```

- Setup database (Postgres):

  Since we must choose a database when opening Postgres with xorm, you should prepare a database manually before running Casdoor. 

  Let's assume that you have already prepared a database called `casdoor`, then you should specify `app.conf` like this:

  ```ini
  driverName = postgres
  dataSourceName = "user=postgres password=xxx sslmode=disable dbname="
  dbName = casdoor
  ```

  **Please notice:** You can add Postgres parameters in `dataSourceName`, but please make sure that `dataSourceName` ends with `dbname=`. Or database adapter may crash when you launch Casdoor.

- Other database...

## Run

After completing the above simple configuration steps, you can run Casdoor. Casdoor has a front-end back-end separation architecture. The frontend uses javascript and React, backend uses [beego](https://beego.me/) and xorm.

### backend

```shell
go run main.go
```

Or build first, and run:

```shell
go build && ./main
```

### frontend

Casdoor's package management tool uses npm and yarn, so you can choose any. Open a new terminal and run:

```sh
cd web

## npm
npm install
npm run start

## yarn
yarn install
yarn run start
```

Well done, next visit http://127.0.0.1:7001 in your favorite browser, if you can see login page of Casdoor, it means everything is ok!

## Some details

- Github corner

  We added a Github icon in the upper right corner, linking to your Github repository address.
  You could set `ShowGithubCorner` to hidden it.

  Configuration:

    ```javascript
  export const ShowGithubCorner = true

  export const GithubRepo = "https://github.com/casbin/casdoor" //your github repository
    ```

- OSS conf

  We use an OSS to store and provide user avatars. You must modify the file `conf/oss.conf` to tell the backend your OSS info. For OSS providers, we support Aliyun(`[aliyun]`), awss3(`[s3]`) now.

  ```
  [provider]
  accessId = id
  accessKey = key
  bucket = bucket
  endpoint = endpoint
  ```

  Please fill out this conf correctly, or the avatar server won't work!

- App conf

  `conf/app.conf` stores the important configuration of casdoor, which is very helpful for you to use Casdoor better.

  ```
  appname = casdoor
  httpport = 8000
  runmode = dev
  SessionOn = true
  copyrequestbody = true
  driverName = mysql
  dataSourceName = root:123@tcp(localhost:3306)/
  dbName = casdoor
  authState = "casdoor"
  useProxy = false
  verificationCodeTimeout = 10
  ```

  - `appname` is the application name, which currently has no practical use
  - `httpport` is the port that your back-end application is listening on
  - `rundev` is `dev` or `prod`
  - `SessionOn` decides whether to enable session,used by default
  - `driverName`, `dataSourceName` and `dbName` are introduced before, so wont't repeat.
  - `useProxy` set the proxy port, because we have google-related services, which will be restricted by the network in some areas
  - `verificationCodeTimeout` set the expiration time of the verification code. After the expiration, the user needs to obtain it again
  
- If casdoor needs to be publicly accessible(possess public IP), also need to modify `web/src/auth/Auth.js`:

  ```javascript
  export let authConfig = {
    serverUrl: "http://example.com", // your Casdoor URL, like the official one: https://door.casbin.com, or http:1.1.1.1:8000
    ...
  }
  ```
